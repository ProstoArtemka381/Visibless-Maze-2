## First steps

For starters, you will need to [download the project](https://github.com/ProstoArtemka381/Visibless-Maze-2/releases/tag/first) and unzip the "Visibless-Maze-2" archive to any folder.

Next, open up the "levels" folder and create a folder with your first level, for example, "first-level".

If you open the game right now, you will see 2 errors,

To fix these errors, you need to create 2 files in your folder, "main.lua" and "map.png".

If you've done that, your level will appear in the select menu.

Choose your level. If you did everything correctly, a black window will open in the center of your screen.
